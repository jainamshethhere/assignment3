# Company Inventory Page

This is the Third Assignment of CS648 course. It is a SPA created using React, served using Express and Graphql for API integration. A simple inventory page where one can add some product and view all the products added.
The initail setup comes from Assignment 2 and this repo is a copy of that with changs for Assignment 3.

## Initial Step

Run `npm run install` to install all the dependencies.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server and Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Compile Watch Mode
